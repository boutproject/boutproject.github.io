#### Manual

The [user manual](http://bout-dev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) describes
how to get started with BOUT++, and how the code works from the point
of view of someone who hasn't used BOUT++ before. There are separate
developer and coordinate system manuals which are useful when you need
to dig further into how the code works.

#### Forum

Announcements are made through the [Google Groups forum][buggroup]. You can also
ask for help through this forum. Alternatively, you can open an issue on
the [GitHub page][issues].

#### Workshops

BOUT++ workshops have been a mixture of hands-on training sessions,
and discussion of current issues and research topics. The mission of
the workshops are (1) to prepare researchers to use and further
develop the BOUT++ code for edge turbulence, transport, and ELM
simulations of magnetic fusion devices; and (2) to promote effective
collaboration within the BOUT community and beyond.

The slides for (almost) all presentations are available on the
workshop websites:
