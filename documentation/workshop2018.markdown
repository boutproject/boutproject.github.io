<a name="about"/>
#### About
The BOUT++ code is a flexible tool for the simulation of plasma fluid equations, primarily focussed on tokamak edge simulations. This workshop will combine hands-on training in using BOUT++ with lectures on tokamak edge physics, numerical simulation techniques, and related topics. All those with an interest in using BOUT++ or in tokamak edge simulation, are invited to attend.

The aim of this workshop is (1) to prepare researchers to use and further develop the BOUT++ code for edge turbulence, transport, and ELM simulations of magnetic fusion devices; and (2) to promote effective collaboration within the BOUT++ community and beyond.
 
Talks and outcomes from this workshop are stored on Zenodo as the [BOUT++ workshop 2018 community](https://zenodo.org/communities/bout-workshop-york-2018/).

### Travel and Parking

Please follow this link for information on travelling to York Plasma Institute: https://www.york.ac.uk/physics/ypi/contact/

There are good transport links between York Railway Station and the University of York for those travelling by train. The number 66 bus travels directly from the station to campus and a return ticket is £3. This is a frequent service with a journey time of approximately 20 minutes. Alternatively, York Station Taxis have a rank outside the station entrance. 

For those travelling by car, there are a number of pay and display car parks on campus. The closest to the YPI are car park north and car park central (please see map below).

If you will be travelling by car to the workshop and would like a parking space to be reserved for you in car park north or car park north, please provide your car registration number, make and model.

Please note: car parking costs £1 per hour or £6 per day. You can pay using coins or with a mobile phone using RingGo Cashless Parking
