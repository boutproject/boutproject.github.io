#### BOUT++ workshop 2018

**Date**: 5th-7th December 2018

**Location**: York Plasma Institute, University of York, UK YO10 5DQ

The BOUT++ code is a flexible tool for the simulation of plasma fluid equations, primarily focussed on tokamak edge simulations. This workshop will combine hands-on training in using BOUT++ with lectures on tokamak edge physics, numerical simulation techniques, and related topics. All those with an interest in using BOUT++ or in tokamak edge simulation, are invited to attend. There is no fee.

The aim of this workshop is (1) to prepare researchers to use and further develop the BOUT++ code for edge turbulence, transport, and ELM simulations of magnetic fusion devices; and (2) to promote effective collaboration within the BOUT++ community and beyond.

**Registration**: Anyone interested in attending should contact Ben Dudson (benjamin.dudson@york.ac.uk) by August 31st.

#### Video conferencing

**Slides** will, when possible, be shared on [EUROfusion TV channel 5](https://tv.euro-fusion.org/channel5/home). Note that many demonstrations may need to use local computers
and so may not be shared. There is a password, please ask one of the organisers.

If using a H.323 video-conference device, registered to an E.164 compliant gatekeeper,
call the E.164 number:

   004910097920065

If using a H.323 video-conference device NOT registered to an E.164 compliant gatekeeper
(called URI dial), the syntax depends on your vendor as shown below:

ConferenceID = 97920065

LifeSize: 194.95.240.2##ConferenceID
Mirial:   ConferenceID@mcu.vc.dfn.de
Polycom:  mcu.vc.dfn.de##ConferenceID
Sony:     194.95.240.2#ConferenceID
Tandberg: ConferenceID@mcu.vc.dfn.de
Cisco:    ConferenceID@vc.dfn.de
VCON:     n.a.
