### What is BOUT++?

* Framework for writing fluid and plasma simulations in curvilinear geometry
* Finite-difference code, variety of numerical methods and time-integration solvers
* Intended to be quite modular, enabling fast testing of numerical methods
* Can evolve any number of equations, with equations appearing in a readable form
* Primarily designed and tested with reduced plasma fluid models in mind
* Jointly developed by University of York (UK), LLNL, CCFE, DTU, and other international partners

### Maintainers

BOUT++ is currently maintained by the following people:

* Ben Dudson, University of York, UK (_lead maintainer_)
* Peter Hill, University of York, UK
* Joseph Parker, Science and Technology Facilities Council, UK
