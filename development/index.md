### Contributing to BOUT++

If you would like to help contribute to BOUT++ then there are many things you
can do which will make a difference. There are projects large and small which a
student or researcher could use to get started with BOUT++ and get more familiar
with the code. You don't need to be particularly familar with BOUT++ or C++ to
work on many of these. You can see a current list of outstanding bugs and
feature requests on the [GitHub issue page][issues].

### House rules

BOUT++ consists of about 60,000 lines of C/C++, along with 18,500 lines of IDL
and 12,000 of Python. Of this, about 40,000 lines is the core BOUT++ code, and
the remainder a mix of pre- and post-processors, and physics modules. As
production codes go, this is not particularly huge, but it is definitely large
enough that keeping the code ‘clean’ and understandable is necessary. This is
vital if many people are going to work on the code, and also greatly helps code
debugging and verification. There are therefore a few house rules to keep in
mind when modifying the BOUT++ code.

When modifying the core BOUT++ code, please keep in mind that this portion of
the code is intended to be general (i.e. independent of any particular physical
system of equations), and to be used by a wide range of users. Making code clear
is also more important in this section than the physics model since the number
of developers is potentially much greater.

Here are some rules for editing the core BOUT++ code:

- **NO FORTRAN**. EVER. Though it may be tempting for scientific programmers to
   use a little Fortran now and then, please please don’t put any into BOUT++.
   Use of Fortran, particularly when mixed with C/C++, is the cause of many
   problems in porting and modifying codes.<br/><br/>
-  If a feature is needed to study a particular system, only include it in the
   core code if it is more generally applicable, or cannot be put into the
   physics module.<br/><br/>
-  If you add a new feature, function, class member, etc. you must also include
   doxygen comments that explain what each new thing does. Similarly, if a change
   you make would affect e.g. a function's arguments, please ensure that you keep
   the documentation up-to-date with the code. See the section on coding style
   for best practices in this regard. If you submit a pull request that doesn't
   add or update documentation where appropriate, we may ask you to do so before
   it is merged.

### Development workflow using Git

The workflow we use is essentially ["gitflow"][gitflow].

- **master** should always be stable
- **next** contains bleeding-edge features

All work should be done in feature branches, branched off *next*.  When
complete, a pull request can be submitted.

At irregular intervals, we will create a **release** branch. No new features go
into the *release* branch - only bug fixes and documentation.

1. Create a new branch
2. (Optional) Push it to Github to share and for backup
3. Make changes, commits
4. Submit a pull request into **next** using Github's [Pull Requests][PRs]
   system

#### Creating a feature branch

First get a copy of the [BOUT-dev] repository (or git pull to update an existing
copy):

    git clone git@github.com:boutproject/BOUT-dev.git
    cd BOUT-dev

Create a new branch **myfeature**, branching from **next**. Choose a descriptive
name for **myfeature**, anything except "master" or "next".

    git checkout next
    git pull
    git checkout -b myfeature     # Switched to a new branch "myfeature"

#### Pushing to Github

Create a fork on Github following the instructions [here][forking].

If you want to push your branch to BOUT-dev to share with other developers, run:

    git push -u yourfork myfeature

This command pushes **myfeature** to your fork (named **yourfork**) of the
BOUT-dev repository, and the -u flag adds it as a remote tracking branch.  After
setting up the tracking branch, you can call "git push" without any parameters
to push updates to **myfeature**.

If another developer wants to try out this branch, they will first need to add
your repository as a new remote:

    git remote add yourfork https://github.com/YourUsername/BOUT-dev.git

then they will be able to checkout your branch:

    git checkout -b myfeature yourfork/myfeature

*Note*: If you have write access to the central BOUT-dev repository, you can
push your branches there.

#### Making changes, commits

Now you would make changes, commit changes and push as usual:

    ... make changes ...
    git add <files>
    git commit
    git push   # Pushes to origin/myfeature

You can switch between branches using *checkout*:

    git checkout master    # Switch to "master"
    git checkout myfeature # Switch to "myfeature"

#### Merging into **next**

Once your feature is complete, ask other developers to have a look by creating
a [Pull Request][PRs] on the [BOUT-dev] page. One of the maintainers will review
your code and merge it into **next**. They may give you comments to improve the
code. You can make additional changes and push them to the same feature branch
and they will be automatically added to the pull request.


### Coding Style

Code is read an order of magnitude more times than it is written. It's also
written for *people* and not for the computer! For these reasons, it's important
that we stick to some form of coding standards. The following coding style
guidelines broadly follow the [LLVM Coding Standards][LLVM]. The LLVM Coding
Standards go into more depth, and explain the reasoning behind the guidelines
more thoroughly than here. If you just follow the guidelines below, you won't go
far wrong though.

These guidelines are intended to make code easier to read and therefore easier
to understand. Being consistent in coding style also helps comprehension by
reducing cognitive load.


#### Comments

Comments in the code are vital to helping understanding. Comments that
are embedded in the code should explain **why** something is done,
rather than **how**.

For documenting what functions and classes do, we use [Doxygen][doxygen].

- Prefer C++ style comments `//` over C style `/* */`
- Doxygen comments: use `///`.
<br/><br/>
  Doxygen done right:
<br/><br/>
  ``` cpp
  /// Foo the bar
  ///
  /// Apply the standard foo method to @p bar
  ///
  /// Typical usage:
  ///
  ///    foo(bar, "simple", result);
  ///
  ///
  /// @param[in] quux Number of times to foo
  /// @param[out] result filled with quux fooed bars
  ///
  /// @returns true on success
  bool applyFoo(BoutReal bar, int quux, std::vector<int> &result);
  ```
- The header files are essentially the "public" API, so prefer to put
  Doxygen comments there, rather than in the implementation. "Private"
  functions, etc., can be documented in the implementation.

#### Naming

Naming things correctly is super important! It is also one of the trickiest
parts of coding.

Names should be *descriptive*. Code is read an order of magnitude more
often than it is written, so it is vital that it is easy to comprehend.

There are some conventions you should follow when naming things:

- Type or class names should be nouns and be PascalCase --
  e.g. BoutReal, BoutMesh, Laplacian
- Variable names should be nouns and snake_case -- e.g. generator, forward_map,
  extra_yguards_lower
- Functions should be verbs (i.e. actions) and camelCase --
  e.g. solve, getSection, parseString

Prefer a longer descriptive name over a shorter abbreviated one:
`inner_boundary_flags` rather than `inbndflgs`, `generator` rather than
`gen`. It's much easier to read and comprehend than the abbreviated form.

#### Details

- Use spaces instead of tabs. Tabs may be interpreted differently by different
  editors, making the code look badly indented and difficult to read. The
  easiest solution is just use spaces everything instead.
- Two spaces for indentation
- Spaces after `if`, `for`, etc.
<br/><br/>
  Wrong:
  ``` cpp
  if(expr){
    doSomething();
  }else{
    doOtherThing();
  }
  ```
  Right:
  ``` cpp
  if (expr) {
    doSomething();
  } else {
    doOtherThing();
  }
  ```
  This especially helps readability, making conditional statements stand out
  over function calls.
- Braces on same line as statement:
<br/><br/>
  Wrong:
  ``` cpp
  void doFoo(bool expr)
  {
    if (expr)
    {
      doSomething();
    }
    else
    {
      doOtherThing();
    }
  }
  ```
  Right:
  ``` cpp
  void doFoo(bool expr) {
    if (expr) {
      doSomething();
    } else {
      doOtherThing();
    }
  }
  ```
  This one is more style than readability - it's the style that the majority of
  BOUT++ already uses.
