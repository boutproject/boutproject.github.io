I'm happy to announce the release of BOUT++ v4.3.2, which fixes
several bugs in the library code, examples and the project
infrastructure:

- Make downloading the submodules a bit nicer, including an option for
  using non-bundled versions when using `configure`
- Make `dz` in the Python API a property
- Make `Div_par_K_Grad_par` check the staggered location of its inputs
- Enable split-flux derivatives on staggered fields
- Fix `Grad2_par2` implementation in `InvertParCR`
- Fix an issue writing `FieldPerp`s
- Make it easier to compile the examples with different versions of
  BOUT++, plus fixes for the `tokamak-2fluid` example
- Fix `Div_par` when using more than one y-guard cell
- Fix an issue with text attributes in HDF5 files
