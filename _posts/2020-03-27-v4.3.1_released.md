These are strange times, but there is a little light: a BOUT++ bugfix
release!

4.3.1 is a bugfix release, with a few minor fixes to library code,
notably:
- Fix the creation of the `RGN_OUTER_X` region
- Several small bugs in the Python API
- Preserve restart files if there's a crash during initialisation
- Fix some segfaults in the PvodeSolver
- Fix some issues with Hypnotoad (see
  [\#1783](https://github.com/boutproject/BOUT-dev/pull/1783)
  ([friva000](https://github.com/friva000)))

Other changes are mostly housekeeping changes for the BOUT++ project.
