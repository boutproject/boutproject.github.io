I am very happy to announce the release of BOUT++ v4.3.0! This is a
feature release and is backwards compatible with v4.2. The headline
features are:

- New derivatives machinery allows native vectorisation where
  possible, as well as OpenMP parallelisation
- We now handle both staggered and field-aligned Fields more
  consistently, with more checking that operations make sense and are
  done in the correct space or at the correct location
- Multiple parallel slices (the new name for "yup" and "ydown")
  re-enables 4th-order central differencing in the y-direction
- Up to 10% faster over v4.2.2!

We have removed a few deprecated features, which you can read in the
change summary below.

You can read a summary of all the changes and download a tarball here:

Many thanks for all the people who contributed to this version,
including those who submitted bug reports!

The plan now for BOUT++ is to start a new major version, with the
opportunity to redesign some parts of the library in a potentially
backwards incompatible way. We intend to support v4 at least until the
release of v5.0, backporting new features where possible, and
providing a route for upgrading to the next version. With that in
mind, I would like to strongly recommend sticking to v4.3 for
production simulations, and only using the "next" branch for
development work.
