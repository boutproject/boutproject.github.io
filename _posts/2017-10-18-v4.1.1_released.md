- Don't pause on showing plot for FCI test by default
- Fix broken integrated tests that aren't run in the test suite
- Initialise some uninitialised variables
- Cleanup all `Array` instances at end of simulation
- Set boundaries correctly in `Delp2`
- Set PYTHONPATH when running tests
- Fix some segfaults caused by `Field3D` move constructors
- Fix some errant newlines when specifying `-q` on the command line
- Fix some segfaults in `ConditionalOutput`
- Fix broken links and code blocks in the documentation
